Project Title : DataSpark : Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics 

Domain : Retail Analytics in the Electronics team 

Problem statement :
        As part of Global Electronics' data analytics team, the task is to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover valuable insights from the companyâ€™s data. The goal is to provide actionable recommendations that can enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive overall business growth.

Business Use case:
        By analyzing Global Electronics' customer, product, sales, and store data, we aim to identify key insights that will enhance marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, and improve sales forecasting. This will help tailor marketing campaigns, develop better products, plan effective promotions, and decide on store expansions and optimizations. Additionally, understanding the impact of currency exchange rates on sales will allow for better international pricing strategies. Overall, these insights will help Global Electronics increase customer satisfaction and drive business growth.

Approach:
Data Cleaning and Preparation
    1.Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
    2.Convert data types where necessary (e.g., dates, numerical values).
    3.Merge datasets where necessary for analysis (e.g., linking sales data with product and customer data).
    
Load Data
    1.Insert the preprocessed data into an SQL database by creating relevant tables for each data source and using SQL INSERT statements to load the data.
    
Power BI Visualization
     1.Connect SQL to Power BI/Tableau, import the data, and create interactive dashboards.

Develop 10 SQL Queries
      1.Formulate and execute 10 SQL queries to extract key insights from the data. These queries should address important business questions and support the analysis steps below.

Analysis Steps:

Customer Analysis
        Demographic Distribution: Analyze the distribution of customers based on gender, age (calculated from birthday), location (city, state, country, continent).
        Purchase Patterns: Identify purchasing patterns such as average order value, frequency of purchases, and preferred products.
        Segmentation: Segment customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior to identify key customer groups.
  
Sales Analysis
      Overall Sales Performance: Analyze total sales over time, identifying trends and seasonality
      Sales by Product: Evaluate which products are the top performers in terms of quantity sold and revenue generated.
      Sales by Store: Assess the performance of different stores based on sales data.
      Sales by Currency: Examine how different currencies impact sales figures, considering exchange rates.

Product Analysis
      Product Popularity: Identify the most and least popular products based on sales data.
      Profitability Analysis: Calculate profit margins for products by comparing unit cost and unit price.
      Category Analysis: Analyze sales performance across different product categories and subcategories.

Store Analysis
      Store Performance: Evaluate store performance based on sales, size (square meters), and operational data (open date).
      Geographical Analysis: Analyze sales by store location to identify high-performing regions.

Results: 
        There will be A comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report for Global Electronics, featuring clean and integrated datasets, in-depth insights into customer demographics, purchasing behaviors, product performance, store operations, and currency impact on sales. The report contains visually compelling visualizations and actionable recommendations tailored to enhance marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, improve sales forecasting, guide product development, and inform store expansion and operational decisions. This analysis will empower Global Electronics to increase customer satisfaction, maximize revenue, and drive overall business growth.
